        Rosa Bonheur, original name Marie-Rosalie Bonheur, (born March 16, 1822, Bordeaux, France—died May 25, 1899, Château de By, near Fontainebleau), French painter and sculptor famed for the remarkable accuracy and detail of her pictures featuring animals.
        Toward the end of her career those qualities were accentuated by a lighter palette and the use of a highly polished surface finish.
